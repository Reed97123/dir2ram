dir2ram (0.4) stable; urgency=low

  * - Cleaned up the implementation for the 0.3 additions.
  * - Added 'reboot' as an option for services.  dir2ram will not attempt to 
  *   mount/unmount a directory with this option specified.  
  *   It will still be added to 'insserv' and will be mounted at next reboot.
  * - Added a 'rmdir' to clean up the left over directory stub where the true 
  *   directory was mounted.
  * - Use rsync to allow deletion of files on the actual disk if they were 
  *   deleted in the cache.
  *   Otherwise the use of copy didn't permit any files to be deleted 
  *   in the original directory.

dir2ram (0.3) stable; urgency=low

  * Added capability to use another disk as a cache.  This allows using a larger drive to cache a
  * directory on a flash drive serving as the OS drive.

dir2ram (0.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Change behavior so that subsequent lines with the same directory specified overwrite previous entries.
  * Read all /etc/dir2ram/*.conf configuration files, instead of just dir2ram.conf.  Read in sorted order.

dir2ram (0.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Initial version using the architecture of Matteo Cortese and the implementation structure of Alberto Bursi.
  * Includes:
  *  - Configuration file which contains the directories to mount.
  *  - Allows use of tmpfs or ramfs RAM drives
  *  - Allows use of size limits and performs checks on directory sizes.
  *  - Optionally prunes old logs before syncing back to disk.
  *  - Automatic generation and placement of a /etc/cron.daily script to sync the drives daily.
  *  - Automatically stops dependent services before mounting the directory.  
  *    This avoids corruption of the directory if the service were to try to access the directory 
  *    during mounting.  Services are restarted after the directory has been mounted.
